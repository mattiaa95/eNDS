//  Settings → About → Licenses. The GPLv3 text and the third-party notices,
//  bundled inside the app rather than only linked.
//
//  This matters beyond tidiness: eNDS links melonDS (GPLv3), and GPLv3 §4/§6
//  expect the licence to travel with the work. Someone with no network, or
//  reading on a plane, still has to be able to see the terms the app ships
//  under — a hyperlink to GitHub is not the licence, and it is exactly the
//  detail a reviewer or a licence-conscious user checks first.
