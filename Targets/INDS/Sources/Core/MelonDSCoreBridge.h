/// is loaded.
///
/// Safe to call from the main thread at any time: internally pauses and

/// did not, so anything driven by the DS date/time (day-night cycles, berry
/// growth, daily events) was living in the year
/// 2000. `NDSRomViewController` applies this right after a ROM loads and
/// again whenever the app comes back to the foreground, from
