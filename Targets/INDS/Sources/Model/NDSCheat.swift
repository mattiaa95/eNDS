//  New (no iGBA equivalent — GBA cheats are a different, simpler format).
//  Swift-side model + on-disk persistence for melonDS Action Replay codes.
//  There is no separate database: the on-disk `.mch` file *is* the model
//  (per-cheat `enabled` included), written in melonDS's own ARCodeFile text
//  format (see Vendor/melonDS/src/ARCodeFile.cpp Load/Save) so it stays
//  loadable by `-[MelonDSCoreBridge reloadCheatsFromFile:enabled:]` — and,
//  if anyone ever pulled it out, by upstream melonDS itself.
