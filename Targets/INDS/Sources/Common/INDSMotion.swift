//
//  INDSMotion.swift
//  eNDS
//
//  Shared motion tokens + Reduce-Motion-aware helpers for the UX/animation
//  pass. Every *new* animation introduced by that pass routes through this
//  file instead of hand-rolling its own `Animation`/`UIView.animate` call —
//  keeps the whole app feeling like one system, and keeps "does this respect
//  Reduce Motion" a one-file question instead of an every-call-site one.
//
//  Two call shapes cover almost everything:
//   - `withMotion { ... }` — imperative state changes (mirrors `withAnimation`).
//   - `.motionAnimation(_:value:)` — implicit per-value view animations
//     (mirrors `.animation(_:value:)`), used for the same index-based stagger
//     idiom `WelcomeView` already established (`.animation(...).delay(x),
//     value: someSet)`).
//  A couple of small, reusable primitives (`pressableScale`,
//  `PressableScaleStyle`, `motionBounceSymbolEffect`) live here too since
//  they're pure motion concerns shared by several unrelated screens.
//
//  UIKit call sites (`NDSHUDView`, `NDSRomViewController` — SwiftUI's
//  `Animation` doesn't reach them) get the parallel `INDSMotion.fadeUIKit`
//  helper below instead.
