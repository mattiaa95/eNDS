//
//  INDSReviewPrompt.swift
//  eNDS
//
//  When to ask for a rating without becoming a nuisance.
//
//  The button in Settings › About opens the review page directly, because
//  someone who taps it came for exactly that. This is the opposite: the
//  prompt nobody asked for, which is why it goes through
//  `SKStoreReviewController` — iOS caps that at roughly three times a year
//  and may decide to show nothing at all. That cap is a feature, not a
//  problem: all that is decided here is whether asking is *worth it*.
//
//  It asks on the way back to the library after a decent session — never
//  mid-game, which is where it annoys and where people tap three stars just
//  to get rid of it.
