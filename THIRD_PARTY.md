# Third-party components

Everything compiled into the eNDS binary, including the components that
melonDS itself vendors and builds unconditionally.

License texts travel with the app and with this repository:
`LICENSE` (GPLv3, covers eNDS itself and melonDS),
`Targets/INDS/Resources/Legal/NOTICES.txt` (verbatim notices of every
component above, as BSD/MIT/zlib/LGPL require),
`Targets/INDS/Sources/Vendor/lzma/LICENSE.txt` and
`Targets/INDS/Sources/Vendor/minizip/LICENSE.txt`, plus the notices kept at
the top of each vendored file.

Not compiled in: melonDS's Dolphin-derived JIT (`ENABLE_JIT=OFF`), its
OpenGL renderer, GDB stub, and the net-utils / multiplayer targets — see
`BUILDING.md` for the exact core configuration.

Everything else in `Targets/` is original eNDS code, © Mattia La Spina,
released under the GPLv3 (see `LICENSE`).
